## Possible extensions  

**Logic** : Adding of the 'R' type instruction for logical operation (AND, OR, NOT).

**Mult** : Adding of the 'R' type instruction for multiplication of two number  stored in registers.  

(We may also add **Jump** which is the addition of a new 'J' type of instruction used to make jumps in the execution of instructions. This type of instruction only has one operand : a jump address on 16 bits.
